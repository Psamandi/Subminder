# Subminder
Subminder was a group project developed for Engineering 113 at UCLA. 


In our group we developed a new product to combine users' subscriptions. 
At first, we did some research on users, their subscriptions, and competitive analysis. 
Then we gathered all those information and we came up with the idea of Subminder app. 
After the ideation I put all the ideas into InDesign and designed the prototype there. 
Once I finished the prototype, I imported it into InVision and built the interactive prototype in order to get feedback on designs.
